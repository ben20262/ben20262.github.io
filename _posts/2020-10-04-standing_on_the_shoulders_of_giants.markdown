That titular phrase was originally said by the mathmatician Sir Isaac Newton who may have redefined math and physics as we had then known it in a way that remained for hundreds of years but yet he did not do it alone. He may have derived calculus in a move that single handedly changed our understanding of math but he did not create the math that lead him to calculus. He stood at the height of his predecessors cumulative knowledge and added his own rock to the mountain of human understanding to raise the altitude just that further inch. If that isn't akin to programming languages I don't know what is. JavaScript was begat by Self, Smalltalk, and C. Before C was B, then BCPL, then ALGOL, then Fortran. Every single language we use has been built up over decades by the people who wanted something better for what they do. Who are we to not continue their passion? We benefit from the shoulders of giants. Titans of industry who have raised our mountain to the peak that we stand on today. As such, we are tasked with the raising that mountain for our educational progeny. It doesn't have to be creating a new language. It can be anything at all. Even just helping a new member of our career. You can do it. We all can.
