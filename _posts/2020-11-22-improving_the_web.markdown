A pastime that I've recently taken to is looking at popular websites and seeing their code as much as I can. They really are the best of the best at making streamlined, usable code that just looks gorgeous. So much of the time I'll sit there wondering how they made that menu slide out like it did or admire the little touches that they add to make things more appealing. I'll try things out myself at times as a small exercise to try and mimic their code. I can get pretty close generally but its always far better on the real site. Just a small facet of an enormous project that is continually being added to and honed to perfection.
