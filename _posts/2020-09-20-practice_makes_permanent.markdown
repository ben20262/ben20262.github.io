When I was young my father had training to do as part of his work and the instructor used an altered turn of phrase that I had never heard before. "Practice makes permanent." At the time it became a bit of a joking mantra that we would recite whenever we would be practicing anything from time tables to wood working. Recently, I've come to see it in a different light especially in regards to programming. Truely, there is no such thing as perfection though try as we might to chase such a goal so why strive for the unachievable when we can do so much more? Practice to make your craft permanent in your mind. The more I use a language the more it cements itself in my head so I don't have to look up the sily little things that I once had to. It starts with the basics of declaring variables and functions and moves itself further with complex functions and algorithms to solve problems in a creative and clean way. We as humans can only strive to better ourselves through learning and conscious thought to become greater than the sum of our knowledge in all of its little parts. By permanently cementing these ideas and methods into our minds we make them available to our everyday life for proper utilization and manipulation for us to achieve our end goals. Practice until your knowledge becomes permanent. Then pick a new thing to practice. Always make time for the old one if you can though.
Practice makes permanent,
Ben
