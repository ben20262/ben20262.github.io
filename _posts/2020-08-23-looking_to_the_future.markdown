As I had mentioned in my last post I had been considering furthering my education with a degree to help myself understand my chosen work better. I have decided on getting an associates as there really are no downsides that I can think of. As I work towards my career I can also work towards my education without the heavy stress of being a full time student as well as employee. Also if or rather when I decide to persue a bachelors degree in the future my credits will still count just fine. I can get my associates and utilize it as best I can as well as use the credits for my future degree? If that's not having my cake and eating it too I don't know what is. I plan to learn Java, Visual Basic, C++, and maybe some prcatice with different environments such as mobile apps to help give myself a better understanding of the bigger picture. Until then, keep reaching,
-Ben
