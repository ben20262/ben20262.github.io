Today I was lucky enough to have my 'First Customer'. My friend wanted a simple hangman game to play with her students and wanted to have me make it for her. It's not much and even the application itself is a simple one but it's a good feeling being able to help out a friend and hone my coding skills. The game I wrote with some simple React with a form for accepting the words to do the game with and a simple "Man" that slowly builds as you pick incorrectly. You can enter multiple words or phrases at once and it's a fun way to keep coding.
