There is a vast difference in work depending on mindset. If it's lengthy and you don't want to do it, it can feel like overbearing, impossible. If you love the work that already raises your happiness beyond measure. But it can be much more than that. A love for a career enables a person to reach further than they had previously thought possible. The minimum becomes the maximum as they strive for greatness in a field that they enjoy. As a person that has found that field I love learning more about my work. There are so many little things to learn that I could spend a lifetime doing them and never reach the end. Not to mention that there are more every day. So reach further and find what is there for you.
