One of the most important things in the business world is to have the ability to work together. There really are very few times that one will be able to complete a project wholly on their own even in the world of freelance. I for one, used to have trouble asking for help. I used to try to do everything myself because I thought that I couldn't rely on anyone but myself. In all reality that is a concieted way of thinking. While I may have been good at my job at the time, it wasn't a sustainable or even healthy way of working. I worked that job for years and ended up more burnt out than I have ever been. With my new job, you really can't do everything yourself at all. It fosters a strange sense of reliance for me and my coworkers. I know that they can do the work just as I can, so I rely on them to do so just as they do me. It's been a much better experience for me to work in a healthier environment and I genuinely enjoy the people that I work with. I can only hope that all this teamwork will apply well to my next career as well.
