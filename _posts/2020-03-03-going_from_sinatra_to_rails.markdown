So far we as a class have been building our foundations together and adding new methods and gems to our repertoire as we started with the absolute basic of basics of Ruby and built it into where we are now. When finishing the last project I marveled at how fun and easy it was to basically build a website from scratch and how simple it was to make our routes and views. It was so fun that I even made an extra one for my brother. Little did I know that I was the man from long ago that had seen the wheel for the first time. Rails came up like a freight train and bulldozed all of that. Want a model? Here use rails g. Want every gem you've ever needed thus far? They're all here waiting for you. All of a sudden, I could type out a simple command and build everything that we had been working on for the last few months. But in the words fo a great man with a great name (Uncle Ben from Spiderman), "With great power, comes great responsibility." Rails g is wonderful but it can make a whole lot of clutter. Good simple code can fall by the wayside if I let it and overrely on these speedy, flashy generators for everything. The last thing I need is to forget the basics even in the midsts of these great revolutions. So for now this caveman will enjoy learning to be the engineer of this train rolling down the Rails.

Choo choo,
     -Ben
