As a recent bootcamp graduate, before I attended my school I would have thought that once I completed my course that I would be set for a career to carry me for the rest of my life. As time went on, I realized that not only is that not true, but there are a thousand different directions to continue my education. Different languages with different libraries that can be used in very different ways even within the same library. As time moves on, so does programming and keeping up with the curve can be a daunting task but I truely love it. I thought it odd that learning a few languages was such a restrictive idea but here I come to find that I don't even have to specilize. In fact it seems that the jack of all trades reigns king in the technological world. Why have three employees each with a different language when you can have one that wields all three to create a cohesive application? I hope to be that jack of all trades someday and I hope that my education never stops.
