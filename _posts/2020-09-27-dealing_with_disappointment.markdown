Things generally don't go perfectly. In fact it's rare that they go anywhere near perfectly. It can be fun to imagine a perfect society where everything is a neatly run clockwork machine with every part in its place but though that may be heaven for some it would be quite the opposite for others. But only through adversity and challenge can we as humans truely rise to our potential in this world. I for one love challenge which is half of the reason that I got into my current field, to challenge myself further doing what I love. However, even I can become discouraged in the face of so much adversity and adverse outcomes. It's times like these that one should do two things. The first is to take a brief break. Remind yourself of why you're doing this. The task may seem insurmountable but you have time to do it. "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step" as they say(though I get the feeling that the chinese proverb in question probably didn't use miles). So there's no need to be at the finish line when you are well on the path. You'll get there when you are meant to. Might as well have your head squarely on your shoulders when you do right? And after that but your head down and get back to it. Just remember to work smarter not harder. A marathon will always need you to conserve your energy so do your best to power through. I believe in you just as much as I do myself.
