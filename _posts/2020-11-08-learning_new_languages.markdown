I have recently started learning Python in my free time as a way to continue my education. I just found a cheap comprehensive course online and set out to find more for myself. Its really interesting what one language has that others seem to omit. Even though Python may have some similarities to languages I already know it definitely chooses to do things differently. It is easy to use but at the same time has wider applications than many other easy to use languages. It takes much less time to create a new application but can also be pushed beyond other similar languages. JavaScript is great but Python can be used in much larger applications and have better flowing classes and inheritance. But when compared to other languages that can create similar applications of similar complexities, they take far longer to develop and time can always be spent towards new projects or perfecting old ones. I have generally enjoyed Python so far and I think you would too.
