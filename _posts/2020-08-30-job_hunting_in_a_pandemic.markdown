Even with everything going on in the world, from riots to disease, some parts have to keep moving. I myself have been job seeking throughout much of this time of strife and have had little reward for my efforts. But disappointment is not the end by any means. We as people decide when things should end. Only I can decide the end of my search for a career as it only really ends when I quit. So as long as I have the chance to why not keep going? We all have struggled to become more accustomed to this new normal but that's not neccesarily a bad thing for society. While we may see the terror on so many news stations we so often forget the beautiful strength that is shown in the majority. Silent and adept at adapting to our new world, we have come together as a unit to achieve things that I didn't think possible beforehand. With so many wonderful people striving to power on even in uncertain times like these, how could I in good concious do anything but the same.

Stay safe,
-Ben
