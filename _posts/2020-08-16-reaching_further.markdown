Recently I've been giving a lot of thought towards the future. Particularly about the direction of my career and what I can do to better it. The idea that I keep coming up with is higher learning. I may have some knowhow and the means to use it but the further I delve into this technological world the more I realise that a degree could only stand to benefit me. There are many directions to take and this decision is an important one for sure but as I have already started down one path and truely loved the journey that it's taken me on, I think I'll continue with Web Design. I hope to further myself in every possible way and glean as much information as I can be offered and hopefully in the end come out with better understanding than I've ever had.
