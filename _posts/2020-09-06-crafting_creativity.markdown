When I was young I grew up on flash games. There was something so free about them that drew me in. I loved to try out any new ones that came out day by day. I think the reason I loved them so much is because they were so variable. You could have one game that was a sidescrolling shooter with a suprising amount of depth and the next would be a game about a virtual club revolving around penguins and their activities. Some of these games stick with me today as some of the weirdly best games that I have ever played. One such game was titles Fancy Pants. I don't know how many hours the creator of that game put into it but it remains to this day one of the best 2d platformers that I have ever played. The momentum and flow of just running in that game was rewarding in itself that urges the player to run faster and jump higher beyond what you previously thought that you could. I recently made a simple game with JavaScript and after standing back from the finished product I only really had one thought. While mine did a proper job at what I wanted it to do, I could help thinking of these titans that put countless hours into something that they would recieve no reward from. Something that they did as a hobby or to bring joy into peoples lives. My life once upon a time. These men and women made these gorgeous perfect things in the wild west days of flash games and one day I hope that I can stand near them and call myself one of the few who brought joy to the next generation.
