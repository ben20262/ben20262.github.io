I have been working on a larger project for some time now as a favor for my brother and as I tinker with it in my free time I find myself slowly redefining it and even changing the whole idea behind it as I get further. I am probably on my third rewrite by now but I really enjoy finetuning it and making it as useful and usable as I possibly can. It started out as a website that could help his small business but its become a whole different beast since I've started it. I now have a scraper that sorts the information into an api using Ruby on Rails. Then a simple JavaScript program handles the rest as my brother uses the information to help support his way of life. It's a simple thing but the act of learning and gaining the ability to upgrade it is so fun that I genuinely can't wait to implement things when I learn new betterways to streamline the process. So why not apply it to daily life too? I love finding little ways to do things that differ from my norm that might shave down the process a bit or bring me that extra bit of joy just from the process of trying something new. As long as we as a species keep applying a similar idea to our world we'll always be able to reach for more.
