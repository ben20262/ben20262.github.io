When I was growing up, I always enjoyed learning about the hidden mechanisms and backend of day to day things. A peak behind Oz's curtain might dissapoint some who love to believe in the magic of the hidden but I always delighted in the beautiful truth. When we finally got a computer in my household I would spend hours just poking and prodding at it. Trying to figure out how this beautiful piece of technology worked and how it brought such a large world so much closer to my small one. I've always had software engineering in the back of my mind as a great human achievement and something that I might not have the opportunity to learn as it seemed to be so far out of reach that I didn't even know where to begin. However, the object of my questions also became part of the answer. I found a good school to help me learn that's more accessible than ever through the internet. I've always wanted to learn software engineering, but only now does it really seem so possible.
