This week I had created Rails Music Player, a sort of mock image of a music player without so much the actual music. I had wuite a number of models and tables to keep track of for the funtions that I wanted the code to has and it really has me astounded as to how much goes into these huge companies websites and applications. In just this simple fictitious music player I has models and tables for users, songs, artists, genres, playlists, playlist_songs, and user_songs. And all that is without actual sound files and general functionality of the actual player itself! It really helps cement the importance of clean code and cooperation. These huge projects may have had humble beginings of small teams or even just one person but they have become these gargantuan beasts maintained by teams of people. Cooperation and clean, understandable code is not optional at this stage, it's a requirement to efficiently modify and update these models, controllers, views, and everything in between. I hope one day to be up there with them working on projects that are of use to people who need them or maybe just makes their collective day just a bit better.
Sincerly,
