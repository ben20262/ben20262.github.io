This week I was further working on a small hangman game for my friend who wanted to use it as a teaching aid for her students learning English. As I was creating this app with the React I realized that I would need some form of graphics for the hangman to visualize how far along they are to losing or winning the game. I being almost entirely without artistic talent pulled open Microsoft Paint and got to work. I created several images at various stages of completion when I suddenly realized, wow this is terrible! In a real world setting thank goodness that we have the miracle of teamwork to help make up for our own shortcomings as we make up for others. No man is an island and for good reason. We as a species have always relied on group work and as a result are extremely social animals. Time may have changed the goal a bit from hunt to survive to make this application properly and aesthetically pleasing, but we still have that age old bond as humans to help us reach the finish line.
