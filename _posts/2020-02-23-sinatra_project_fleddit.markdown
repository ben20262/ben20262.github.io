For my sinatra project I decided to make my own version of a site that I use quite often. Reddit! While I put in the time and effort I realized more and more that regardless of what effort I myself put in or how snazzy I made the pages with my limited understanding of CSS, what makes Reddit great isn't the platform itself. It's the user's interaction with the platform. An (almost) open forum for exchange for people to express themselves and their ideas through the platform that is provided. So I did what I could to emulate that. After setting up the basics with ActiveRecord and Sinatra, With my fun use of have many through relationships between Pages and Users I left it mostly whole and unaltered from there on. The fun part about Reddit isn't the site itself. It's all the things and people using the site to it's fullest. Maybe one day I'll be the one to make the next Reddit. But for now my small lonely clone will sit in the shadow of something with decades of experience and millions of more users than it.
