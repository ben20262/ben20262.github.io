A long time ago, I had a run in with JavaScript and it didn't make much sense to me. There were so many little things to remember and what we were using it for made it seem like it barely even worked. Sure it was high school and I'm pretty sure the school didn't want us to actually learn how to code in case one of us decided to hack their system (one senior managed to anyway) but it seemed so bulky and inefficient for the simple projects that they gave to us. Cut to modern day and it turns out that JavaScript is actually pretty amazing. They had us doing simple functions and adding and subtracting when we could have been making the internet into what it is today and making the browser games of my childhood. It seems like so long ago I could barely see the point of this thing, but with new knowledge and proper direction it has become this necessary tool in my own slowly widening toolbox. Without it, how would Rockdodger complete his literal name? How would commenting on a post not have to entirely reload a page? How would we have these infinitely scrolling pages to fill our lives with joy? It seems like something so simple when you think about it that normal HTML doesn't quite make the cut with our modern day internet. It's utilitarian but it needs some friends to help class up the place a bit. CSS gives that extra bit of polish and customization that is needed to make our digital world more visually appealing but the maybe the best friend is JavaScript. HTML may show you what to do and how to complete a task but JS is the one behind it guiding the HTML. So next time you click that like button, or scroll farther than the 90s and early 2000s thought was possible, thank JavaScript.
