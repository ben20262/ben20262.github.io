Customer service is an interesting thing because the end goal is to make the customer happy within the confines of your business' service. Most of it is just simple things that people appriciate. An employee taking the time to help them find something perhaps. Or maybe explaining the difference between one product and another. The most important things seem to be simple as well. Take the time to listen. You may not even know what a customer wants until you talk to them. They might not know what they want either! That's why it's important to listen to give them the best response for their questions. The second thing is time. Don't rush them too much. Make sure that they feel comfortable in the interaction and not like they're bothering you. It's easy to get caught up in what you may be doing but always make sure to give them some time.
