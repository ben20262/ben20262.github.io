Every year people flood stores both in person and online to purchase presents for their loved ones. Whether they realize it or not they've been directed by some form of advertising or another. Advertising is an interesting side of web design because it's more than function. It has to be attractive and easy to understand. Look at any sidebar of ads even on google. They're almost always clear and show you exactly what they think you want so that you can navigate to purchase the product. Advertisment is so much more than direct sales though. It can bring understanding to an unknowing public. It might be an ear worm that sticks in your brain until you finally break down and buy it. They all have some for of interaction on our minds but ultimately we are the ones to decide. Some people may hate advertisements but personally I don't mind them. They don't force you to do anything. They make you aware of somthing that you may want. And that's alright by me.
