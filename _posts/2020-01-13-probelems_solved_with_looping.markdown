Looping is an interesting part of coding. You can apply it to most any situation to save yourself time and energy with mundane tasks that you would just have to repeat over and over. I rememeber in the bootcamp prep first doing for and while loops was like a revolution. By properly setting boundries for the loop you can have a task repeat as many times as needed and do in seconds what could take me hours. I specifially love iteration and our more recent use of Nokogiri to glean specific parts of information from the internet without much pain or hard work. With a quick look at the html of a web site and short bit of code you can throw together lists of anything worthy of listing. The iteration takes care of all the heavy lifting and actually saves time. I hope to one day apply this to some of my own worthy lists.
